In this project I worked Baseball player data from kaggle. After getting it I found an updated version on another website, with a complete list of what each category was.

First, I worked with the "primary" data set, the list of all players, and most of their personal stats. This didn't include many stats that one might be interested in, such as what they did on the field. So, I looked at some of the other datasets. First though, I got a couple things I thought might be useful out of it, such as how long each of the players played the game, and how they were when they started playing.

The first thing I decided was worth plotting was the amount of awards given out by year. as it turns out, not very many 

I then melted the data, and observed that a few zip codes didn't have complete data. I figured this was because they recently came into existence. There were a couple of those on the Denver graph as well. Since there were only 6, out of over 500, it seemed reasonable to just drop them. Anyway, there may not be enough data to work with when predicting.
